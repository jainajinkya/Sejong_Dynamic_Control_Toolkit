# RBDL_Simulator Systems

1. Each system must have (name is important, class names are needed to be identical to the file name) 

   * Plotsys_{CTRL_SYS}.hpp
   * Plotsys_{CTRL_SYS}.cpp
   * {CTRL_SYS}_Dyn_Ctrl.hpp
   * {CTRL_SYS}_Dyn_Ctrl.cpp
   * SIM_{CTRL_SYS}_Definition.h

2. The other files' names are not critical
