# RBDL_Simulator Systems

* Each system must have (name is important, class names are needed to be identical to the file name) 
 * Plotsys_{CTRL_SYS}.hpp
 * Plotsys_{CTRL_SYS}.cpp
 * {CTRL_SYS}_Dyn_Ctrl.hpp
 * {CTRL_SYS}_Dyn_Ctrl.cpp
 * SIM_{CTRL_SYS}_Definition.h

* The other files' names are not critical
